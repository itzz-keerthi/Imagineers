The key principle is the bias-variance tradeoff. High bias models are too simplistic and underfit the data, while high variance models are too complex and overfit. The sweet spot is finding the right balance that minimizes both bias and variance to achieve optimal generalization performance.",

We use techniques like cross-validation to detect this. Another telltale sign is when your learning curves show the training error continuing to decrease while validation error starts increasing. This gap indicates your model is memorizing training data rather than learning generalizable patterns. Regularization techniques like L1, L2, dropout, and early stopping help combat overfitting.",

This creates sparse models by driving some weights to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection. L2 regularization, or Ridge regression, adds the sum of squared parameters. It shrinks weights towards zero but rarely makes them exactly zero. L1 is better when you want automatic feature selection and interpretable models with fewer features. L2 works well when all features are somewhat relevant and you want to prevent any single feature from dominating.",

L1's derivative is constant (+1 or -1), providing consistent pressure to reduce weights by a fixed amount each step, eventually reaching zero. L2's derivative is proportional to the weight value itself (2w), so as weights get smaller, the regularization pressure decreases proportionally. This creates a 'soft landing' effect where weights asymptotically approach but rarely reach exactly zero. Think of L1 as a constant push towards zero, while L2 is like friction that gradually slows down movement towards zero.",

However, there's also Elastic Net, which combines both L1 and L2 penalties, giving you the benefits of both: feature selection from L1 and the stability of L2.

The key principle is that diverse models with different strengths and weaknesses can complement each other.
